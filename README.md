This repo contains the code for the currently released version of iSub, with some modifications to allow building on Xcode 8.3. However, this version is deprecated, and a new rewrite in Swift, modernized for newer devices and large screen sizes, is in progress at http://github.com/einsteinx2/iSub. 

iSub was originally released on iOS 3, before the iPad even came out! There is actually conditional code checking for iOS 3.2 haha! So a lot of this code is extremely outdated. Check out the Swift rewrite for the modern version. It's still beta quality, but functional, and is planned for release this year (2017).
